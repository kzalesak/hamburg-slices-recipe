The game of 66
--------------

## Introduction

Take a set of cards, and separate from it just the upper deck. The upper deck is, as follows, in the order of largest-value (value is called "rank" in card terminology) to smallest (for this game):

1. Ace
2. 10
3. King
4. Queen
5. Jack

So that the Ace beats 10, which beats King, which beats Queen, which beats jack. There are four sets, or colours of each card (so that for example you can find the card with "10" written on it four times, each time with a different symbol or colour next to it). This makes it a total of 20 cards to play with. The cards, as necessary, have these symbols only on one side (the side which shows the value and colour is called "face" in card terminology, so "face up" we can see the value and "face down" we can not). The other is always the same so that our opponent does not know which cards we have (this would be called "face down").


The cards have the following point values:
- "Ace" = worth 11 points
- "10" = worth 10 points
- "King" = worth 4 points
- "Queen" = worth 3 points
- "Jack" = worth 2 points


The game is played with two (2) players. The goal of each round is to get 66 points before the opponent does or the round ends. Whoever manages to do that first wins the round and writes down either 1, 2 or 3 bigpoints based on how the round was played by his or her opponent. Whoever first gets 7 bigpoints wins the biground and the amount of bigpoints resets. Whoever first wins 3 biground wins the game. So the game is effectively played on round level, set level and game level.


## Setup
Mix all cards. Let the other player separate them into two piles by random (called "cut" in card terminology) and put the bottom on on top of the top one. This is done to ensure that the person mixing the cards is not cheating. This "ritual" is an important part of the culture of this game.

The person mixing the cards then distributes three cards to his or her opponent, three cards to himself, then turns over the next card face up and places it on the table, so that both players can see what it is. The colour (called "suite" in card terminology) of this card determines which colour is going to be dominant for the round (called "trumph" in card terminology). Finally, he distributes further two cards to his or her opponent and two cards to himself. He places the remaining pack of cards (called "stock" in card terminology) face down (so that no one can see them). There is now one card face up (that both can see) on the table, a stock on the table and each player has 5 cards in their hand. The opponent does not know what they are. The round is now set up and the game can start. This setup is repeated every round, with the two players taking turns in who mixes and distributes the cards (called "dealing" in card terminology).

## Gameplay
The person who was __not__ dealing cards this round is the first to play and we call him _player 1_. The person who dealt cards in the first round is then called _player 2_. He takes one card out of his or her hand and puts it on the table face up, so both players can see it (called "playing the card" in card terminology). The other person then chooses a card from his or her hand and puts it face up on top of the card already on the table. One of the following five scenarios now arises:

- one of the players played a trump card, while the other one did not -> the player who placed the trump card with the higher rank takes both cards
- both players played a trump card -> the player who played the trump card of higher rank takes both cards
- one player played a non-trump card and the other played a trump card -> the player who played the trump card takes both cards
- both players played a card of the same suite -> whoever played the card with the higher rank takes both cards
- each player played a card of a different suite, both suites being non-trump -> the player who played first takes both cards 

Upon taking the cards, the player who took them places them face down in front of him so that no one can see them, adds the point value (how much is the card worth) and adds this to his score. The cards now form an ordered pair (called "trick" in card terminology) that one player got the points for. It is for the player who got the trick (took it to his side) to now start. Both players take one card from the stock, starting with the player who just got the trick.

> E.g. player 1 starts the game by putting down an ace of spades (type of card suite) and player 2 puts a Queen of hearts on top (another card suite). The card revealed during dealing was a king of hearts, thus the suite of hearts is the trumph suite for the round. Player 2 takes both cards and remembers that he now has 13 points.

Once one of the players think they have reached 66 points in total, they say "Enough!" and both players then proceed to count their points. If he indeed has 66 or more points, he wins the round. If his opponent did not score a single point during this round, then he notes down 3 bigpoints for this round. If his opponent managed to get a trick at least once (thus scoring points), but has less then 33 points, then the player who won marks down 2 bigpoints. If his opponent scored more then 33 points, then the winning player notes down 1 bigpoint. If the player did not in fact have 66 or more points (he was mistaken), then his opponents marks down 3 bigpoints. If neither player has declared "Enough!" by the time the last trick is taken, then the player who takes the last trick automatically gains 3 bigpoints and wins this round. The round is then restarted

## Declarations
At any given time of the game, if the player who is about to play has a Queen and a King in his hands (he has to be the first one to put down a card at this point in the game), he can show both to the opponent and play one of them. This gives him automatically 20 points, or, in case the King and Queen are of the trumph suite, 40 points. This is an important mechanic that players have to take care of if they want to win. 

## Extra rules
At any given point, the player who is about to play can swap a Jack of the trumph suite for the trumph card that was revealed during shuffling.

## Closing
Once the last card has been taken (the revealed one is given to the player who has no card left for him in the stock), respecting colour and trumph rule comes into play. This means that in order:
1. second player to put down a card has to put a card that is of the same suit
2. if he has the same suite and higher rank he has to put that one down
3. if he does not have the same suit, he has to play a trumph card


At any point in the game, the player who is about to play, can double tap the stock, invoking the closed state. This means that the respecting colour and trumph rule is in effect, but no more cards are drawn. The player who did this then has to get at least 66  with the cards in his hand, otherwise the other gets 3 bigpoints. The points of the other player are no longer counted.
