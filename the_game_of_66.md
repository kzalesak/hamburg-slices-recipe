The game of 66
--------------

## Introduction

Take a set of cards, and separate from it just the upper deck. The upper deck is, as follows, in the order of largest-value (value is called "rank" in card terminology) to smallest (for this game):

1. Ace
2. 10
3. King
4. Queen
5. Jack

So that the Ace beats 10, which beats King, which beats Queen, which beats jack. There are four sets, or colours of each card (so that for example you can find the card with "10" written on it four times, each time with a different symbol or colour next to it). This makes it a total of 20 cards to play with. The cards, as necessary, have these symbols only on one side (the side which shows the value and colour is called "face" in card terminology, so "face up" we can see the value and "face down" we can not). The other is always the same so that our opponent does not know which cards we have (this would be called "face down").


The cards have the following point values:
- "Ace" = worth 11 points
- "10" = worth 10 points
- "King" = worth 4 points
- "Queen" = worth 3 points
- "Jack" = worth 2 points


The game is played with two (2) players. The goal of each round is to get 66 points before the opponent does or the round ends. Whoever manages to do that first wins the round and writes down either 1, 2 or 3 bigpoints based on how the round was played by his or her opponent. Whoever first gets 7 bigpoints wins the biground and the amount of bigpoints resets. Whoever first wins 3 biground wins the game. So the game is effectively played on round level, set level and game level.


## Setup
Mix all cards. Let the other player separate them into two piles by random (called "cut" in card terminology) and put the bottom on on top of the top one. This is done to ensure that the person mixing the cards is not cheating. This "ritual" is an important part of the culture of this game.

The person mixing the cards then distributes three cards to his or her opponent, three cards to himself, then turns over the next card face up and places it on the table, so that both players can see what it is. The colour (called "suite" in card terminology) of this card determines which colour is going to be dominant for the round (called "trumph" in card terminology). Finally, he distributes further two cards to his or her opponent and two cards to himself. He places the remaining pack of cards (called "stock" in card terminology) face down (so that no one can see them). There is now one card face up (that both can see) on the table, a stock on the table and each player has 5 cards in their hand. The opponent does not know what they are. The round is now set up and the game can start. This setup is repeated every round, with the two players taking turns in who mixes and distributes the cards (called "dealing" in card terminology).

## Gameplay
The person who was __not__ dealing cards this round is the first to play and we call him _player 1_. The person who dealt cards in the first round is then called _player 2_. He takes one card out of his or her hand and puts it on the table face up, so both players can see it (called "playing the card" in card terminology). The other person then chooses a card from his or her hand and puts it face up on top of the card already on the table. One of the following scenarios now arises:

The cards now form an ordered pair (called "trick" in card terminology). One of the following five scenarios now arises:
- The first card was of lower value (rank) then the second one and they were of the same suite -> player who played second (player 2) takes both cards
- The first card was of higher value (rank) then the second one and they were of the same suite -> player who played first (player 1) takes both cards
- The first card was of a different suite then the second one -> player who played first (player 1) takes both cards
- The first card played was not a trumph card, the second card played was a trumph card, regardless of rank -> player who played second (player 2) played
