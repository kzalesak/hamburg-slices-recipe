# Hamburg Slices Recipie

The recipie enclosed is one of the best recipies of my grandma, which she usually bakes for chirstmas. There are two versions enclosed:
  1. the original Czech text, as I wrote it down when I came to visit her in the year 2019 (with added formatting and typos corrected)
  2. an English translation made specifically in the hope that people will be able to read it 1000 years later.
  
 The rest of this readme contains some background about where this recipie is from, some defenitions and a list of descriptions of concepts that I think might be necessary to understand this recipie in the distant future.
 
 Why is it called Hamburg slices, after the city of Hamburg in Germany, I do not know.

## Origins of the recipie
My grandma, who lives in a small town in the south-east reion of the Czech Republic, a country which itself lies in the center of a continent called Europe, is a well renowned cook. She has never made cooking her work (that she would do for a living), but her skills of how to prepare food set her apart from most people that I know. 

During Christmas, a christian celebration at the end of the year, at the end of December, mid winter in the Czech Republic, she would bake various kinds of small sweets, we could say various kinds of "traditional biscuits". This is common for the people in my country to do.

In the year 2019, I decided that I'm going to record (write down and photograph) all the recipies that se makes, so that generations to come can keep enjoying them. The one described here is my favourite, and it just so felt right that this one should be archived in Svalbard, with the hopes that some very distant generation will be able to recreate it. 

## Things needed to understand the recipie
There are a few words and things in the recipie that are key to understanding how to make it, for which I include copied articles from Wikipedia. Wikipedia is a book written by many people all across the world. It is written (and usually read) using computers and phones. The following articles are included in the `supporting_articles` folder in this repository:

## Structure of the files
The files included in this recipie are al formated as markdown, a type of text file same as this one. There are also some images. They are included as both gif (in the `gif` folder) and png (in the `png`) folder. To display these, software from this very archive can be used. There are many - a `gif decoder` or `png decoder` should be searched for.
